# Project Vision

Referencing the project details for Deliverable 2 & 3, along with the video of the gameplay:

##  Describe how the game will unfold i.e. The first wave lasts for 10 seconds, X happens during this time. The second wave ....

Include details for each wave like:

How many lives the player has
How much HP the bosses have
Each new level / wave has a sound that says "Shake N Bake!!"

##Overview:

###There are 4 phases:

* Regular play with grunts
* Mid Boss Attack
* Bosses need more sophisticated attacks
* More Grunts
* Final Boss

Bosses need more sophisticated attacks
Bosss must have two different stages of attack, mimicking the first stage and third stage of the demo video
