# Project Vision

Referencing the project details for Deliverable 2 & 3, along with the video of the gameplay:

##  Describe how the game will unfold i.e. The first wave lasts for 10 seconds, X happens during this time. The second wave ....

Include details for each wave like:

How many lives the player has
How much HP the bosses have
Each new level / wave has a sound that says "Shake N Bake!!"

## Overview:

### There are 4 phases:

* Regular play with grunts
    * The first wave will render 10 regular enemies.
    * Only two enemies will be on the screen at one time and everytime and enemie dies a new one is rendered on screen until all 10 have dies.
    * The enimies will shoot 2 projectile patterns, straight down and zigzag down. 
    * Also include other information such as how many lives the player has, or the HP of bosses, etc. Use the video as a reference.
